## chalknvim.lua
Basically my neovim config repo in case if I would like to undo config changes I made on my computer.

##
This repo would be regularly updated as my config is still not mature enough to effectively code in.

## Setup
I'll not include compiled plugin folder, so just do
```
make install
and
:PackerSync
```
before using.
